# Code Documentation Standards

When modifying code, always follow these documentation principles:

## Comment Preservation
- Never remove existing comments when modifying code
- Update existing comments to reflect changes in functionality
- Preserve the style and format of existing comments

## New Code Documentation
- Add descriptive comments for all new functions, classes, and complex logic
- Document the purpose, parameters, return values, and exceptions
- Use JSDoc/TSDoc style for JavaScript/TypeScript files
- Use docstrings for Python files
- Include examples for non-obvious implementations

## Comment Updates
- When changing functionality, update the associated comments
- If refactoring code, ensure comments remain accurate
- When fixing bugs, add a comment explaining the fix and why it works

## Code Deletion
- When removing code, document why it was removed in nearby comments
- If functionality is being replaced, add a comment referencing the new implementation

## Comment Style Guidelines
- Write comments in complete sentences
- Use present tense for describing what code does
- Be concise but thorough
- Avoid redundant comments that simply restate the code
- Focus on explaining "why" rather than "what" when the code is self-explanatory
