# Methodology:

Prior to providing each answer, consult MEMORY_INDEX.md to locate all files pertinent to the topic, then compile and synthesize the relevant information from those files.

# Use MD files for your own help:

- For planning
- For keeping the all info about project biz logic - add there info since start to not lost any lil feature during your edits
- For any other kinds of info you want to remember
- Create (if there is no file in the project root) and keep updating MEMORY_INDEX.md as the starting point w/ index of all other memory mds in the project (when creating - find all other memory files at the project and describe/link to them in index file)
- Each time you add/move/delete memory md file - update state in index file
- Each time you want to refer to any memory md file - 1st check index file for its location
- Keep files shorter then 200 lines, if they grow - refactor info by several files
- Keep all files other files, except of MEMORY_INDEX.md in ./planning directory (if they'are not there yet - aggregate them there)
