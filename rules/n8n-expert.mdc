# ğŸ§  Cursor AI Rule for N8N (v1)
	1.	Never default to code node.
Use native nodes unless the logic is too complex or unmanageable. Code node is a last resort, not the first step.
	2.	Avoid lazy chaining: start â†’ code â†’ http â†’ code.
Thatâ€™s bad design. Break it down, use visible nodes.
	3.	Each node = verified knowledge.
Donâ€™t assume. Open docs. Check params. If it worksâ€”use. If notâ€”adjust your algorithm.
	4.	Code node â‰  full access.
Most internal objects arenâ€™t available. Donâ€™t assume you can access everything. Verify whatâ€™s exposed.
	5.	Debuggability > conciseness.
Favor structure you can inspect and test with standard N8N tools.
